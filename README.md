# mt94rep

## Stimulation
Scripts are for Psychtoolbox for Octave on Linux

### Usage
mt94rep_le( subjnr, cond, blocknr )

### Condition numbers
1. Shepard repetition (3 blocks, replication)
2. Shepard descending (3 blocks, replication)
3. Sinusoidal repetition (3 blocks, replication)
4. Sinusoidal descending (3 blocks, replication)
  
5. Shepard regular repetition 3 (1 Block; A B C C D E E ...)
6. Shepard regular repetition 4 (1 Block; A B C D D E F G G ...)
7. Shepard regular descending 3 (1 Block; A B C B C D C ...)
8. Shepard regular descending 4 (1 Block; A B C D C D E F E ...)

### Comments on stimulus randomization
There were at least two standards between two deviants. No specifications were made in the original manuscript.

No deviants could occur after the ascending pitch change in the repetition and descending sinusoidal conditions. No specifications were made in the original manuscript.

Deviants were equally distributed across pitch levels. No specifications were made in the original manuscript.
